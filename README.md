# F.A.S.T. (Fab Lab Automated Stock Taker)
A 50.001 Introduction to Information System and Programming 1D Project aimed to digitize stock management in Fab Lab. 

## What is F.A.S.T. ?
F.A.S.T. is an application that digitises the process of taking items from the Fabrication Lab. This simultaneously makes it more convenient for SUTD students to take items, as well as for Fab Lab staff to keep track of item stock. Our application achieves this by making use of firebase as the central database - keeping track of the current stock of items and all transactions that were made by the students. 

## How does it work?
With two different sides to the application, one for students and one for the staff, F.A.S.T. provides features tailored to the needs of both parties. For students, most data will be filled in automatically, allowing them to quickly and easily key in the rest of the information required. Meanwhile, Fab Lab staff will be able to check the current stock and view the transaction history from the staff side of the app. They will also get a notification when any of the stock is below the threshold that they specified beforehand.
